### **1\. Product Roadmap & Feature Backlog**

This roadmap outlines the planned evolution of the Mobilify Pro solution after the initial launch. It is designed to be flexible but provides a clear direction for future development efforts.

#### **Version 1.0: MVP Launch (Target: August 29, 2025\)**

* **Focus:** Core functionality for a single restaurant.  
* **Features:**  
  * Secure User Authentication  
  * Real-time Order Management (The "Kanban" view)  
  * Basic Menu Management (CRUD operations)  
  * Basic Reservation Management  
  * Simple Push Notification Broadcasting  
  * **Goal:** Onboard the first 5 clients.

#### **Version 1.1: The "Efficiency" Update (Q4 2025\)**

* **Focus:** Improving the restaurant owner's quality of life and operational speed.  
* **Feature Backlog:**  
  * **\[P1\] Advanced Push Notifications:** Ability to schedule notifications for a future time and segment users (e.g., send only to customers who haven't ordered in 30 days).  
  * **\[P1\] Daily Sales Report:** A simple, automatically generated report showing total sales, number of orders, and most popular items for the day.  
  * **\[P2\] Staff Roles & Permissions:** An "Owner" role with full access and a "Staff" role that can only manage orders and reservations but cannot change menu prices or settings.

  * **\[P3\] Basic Customer Analytics:** A dashboard showing new vs. returning customers and top spenders.

#### **Version 2.0: Multi-Industry Expansion (Mid-2026)**

* **Focus:** Adapting the white-label solution for a new business vertical.  
* **Potential Target:** Retail / Local E-commerce.  
* **Features:** Will require a new PRD, but will leverage the core architecture (auth, notifications, etc.) built for the restaurant solution.

### **2\. Vibe Coding Checklist (Rules for the AI Partner)**

This is a final set of instructions to be referenced during the development phase to ensure the AI's output aligns perfectly with our established standards.

* **✅ Adhere to the `Coding Standards Guide` at all times.** This is the constitution for our codebase. Pay special attention to the Clean Architecture file structure (`/services`, `/hooks`, `/pages`).  
* **✅ Reference the `UI/UX Design Assets` for all styling.** Use the defined color palette, typography, and component styles. Do not invent new visual styles.  
* **✅ Implement Error Handling as defined in the `Error Digest`.** For any function that can fail (especially API/database calls), implement the specified `try/catch` logic and provide user-friendly feedback.  
* **✅ Decompose Problems into Atomic Steps.** When given a complex task, break it down into smaller, logical sub-tasks that align with our documents. For example, when asked to "build the orders page," first define the data structure, then the service, then the hook, then the UI components.  
* **✅ Ask for Clarification.** If a prompt is ambiguous or conflicts with an existing document, ask for clarification before generating code. For example: "The prompt asks for a feature that is listed as 'Out of Scope' in the PRD. Should I proceed?"  
* **✅ Prioritize Security.** All code that handles user input or interacts with the database must be written with the security patterns from the `Coding Standards Guide` in mind. Never trust client-side data.
