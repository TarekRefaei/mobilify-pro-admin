# **Testing Plan: Mobilify Pro Admin Panel**

* **Document Version:** 1.0  
* **Date:** July 25, 2025  
* **Core Purpose:** To define the validation strategy, tools, and test cases required to ensure a reliable, high-quality application.

### **1\. Testing Strategy & Scope**

This plan covers the testing of the Mobilify Pro Admin Panel (v1.0). Our strategy employs a multi-layered approach to ensure quality at all levels of the application, from individual functions to the complete user workflow.

* **Unit Tests:** To verify that individual functions and React components work correctly in isolation.  
* **Integration Tests:** To ensure that multiple components work together as expected (e.g., a form submitting data that then appears in a list).  
* **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** To simulate real user workflows from start to finish in a browser, verifying the application as a whole.  
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Manual testing performed by the stakeholder (Tarek Refaei) to confirm the application meets business requirements before launch.

### **2\. Testing Frameworks & Tools**

* **Unit & Integration Testing:**  
  * **Framework:** `Vitest` \- A modern test runner designed for Vite, offering a fast and seamless experience.  
  * **Library:** `React Testing Library` \- For testing React components by interacting with them as a user would.  
* **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**  
  * **Framework:** `Cypress` \- For running automated tests that simulate user journeys in a real browser environment.  
* **Performance Testing:**  
  * **Tool:** `Google Lighthouse` \- To audit performance, accessibility, and SEO, ensuring we meet our defined benchmarks.

### **3\. Test Cases**

The following test cases are prioritized based on feature importance and risk. The **Order Management** feature is considered the highest risk due to its real-time nature and criticality to the business.

#### **3.1. Authentication**

| ID | Feature | Test Scenario | Steps | Expected Outcome | Type |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **AUTH-01** | Login | Successful login with valid credentials. | 1\. Navigate to `/login`. \<br\> 2\. Enter valid email/password. \<br\> 3\. Click "Sign In". | User is redirected to the dashboard (`/`). No errors are shown. | E2E |
| **AUTH-02** | Login | Failed login with incorrect password. | 1\. Navigate to `/login`. \<br\> 2\. Enter valid email, invalid password. \<br\> 3\. Click "Sign In". | An error message "Invalid credentials" is displayed. User remains on `/login`. | E2E |
| **AUTH-03** | Protected Route | Attempt to access dashboard when logged out. | 1\. Ensure user is logged out. \<br\> 2\. Navigate directly to `/`. | User is immediately redirected to `/login`. | E2E |
| **AUTH-04** | Logout | User can successfully log out. | 1\. Log in successfully. \<br\> 2\. Click the "Logout" button. | User is redirected to `/login`. | E2E |

#### **3.2. Order Management (High-Priority)**

| ID | Feature | Test Scenario | Steps | Expected Outcome | Type |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **ORD-01** | Real-time Display | A new order created in the database appears on the screen instantly. | 1\. Have the `/orders` page open. \<br\> 2\. Manually add a new order document to Firestore with `status: 'pending'`. | The new order card appears in the "New Orders" column within 5 seconds without a page refresh. | Integration |
| **ORD-02** | Audible Alert | A sound plays for a new order but not on initial load. | 1\. Navigate to `/orders`. No sound should play. \<br\> 2\. Manually add a new order to Firestore. | An audible alert plays once. Adding a second order plays the sound again. | Integration |
| **ORD-03** | Status Update | Accepting an order moves it to the correct column. | 1\. On a pending order card, click the "Accept" button. | The card disappears from "New Orders" and reappears in "In Progress". The Firestore document's `status` is updated to `'preparing'`. | Integration |
| **ORD-04** | Empty State | The page displays a helpful message when there are no active orders. | 1\. Clear all active orders from the database. \<br\> 2\. Navigate to `/orders`. | The Kanban columns are visible, but a message like "No active orders" is displayed. | Unit |
| **ORD-05** | Data Loading | A loading indicator is shown while fetching initial data. | 1\. Throttle network speed. \<br\> 2\. Navigate to `/orders`. | A loading spinner or skeleton screen is visible before the order cards appear. | Unit |

#### **3.3. Menu Management (To Be Defined)**

*Test cases for creating, updating, toggling availability, and deleting menu items will be defined here once the feature prompts are developed.*

### **4\. Performance Benchmarks & UAT**

* **Performance:** All performance thresholds defined in the `Technical Specifications` document (v1.1) must be met before deployment. A final Lighthouse audit will be conducted as part of the pre-launch checklist.  
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** The final version of the application will be deployed to a staging environment. Tarek Refaei will perform manual testing based on the use cases defined in the `PRD` (v1.0). A formal sign-off is required before the production launch.
