## **üîí Security Implementation**

### **1. Content Security Policy (CSP)**

#### **Production CSP Headers:**
```javascript
const securityHeaders = {
  'Content-Security-Policy': `
    default-src 'self';
    script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://apis.google.com https://www.gstatic.com;
    style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
    font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;
    img-src 'self' data: https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com;
    connect-src 'self' https://*.firebaseio.com https://*.googleapis.com;
    frame-src 'none';
  `,
  'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
  'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
  'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block',
  'Referrer-Policy': 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin',
  'Permissions-Policy': 'camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()',
  'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains'
};
```

#### **Implementation in Vercel:**
```javascript
// vercel.json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Content-Security-Policy",
          "value": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://apis.google.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-Frame-Options",
          "value": "DENY"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
          "value": "nosniff"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### **2. Firebase Security Rules**

#### **Production Firestore Rules:**
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Restaurant isolation - users can only access their restaurant's data
    match /restaurants/{restaurantId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.uid in resource.data.owners;
      
      // Orders within restaurant
      match /orders/{orderId} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
          && request.auth.uid in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/restaurants/$(restaurantId)).data.owners;
      }
      
      // Menu items within restaurant
      match /menuItems/{itemId} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
          && request.auth.uid in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/restaurants/$(restaurantId)).data.owners;
      }
      
      // Customers within restaurant
      match /customers/{customerId} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
          && request.auth.uid in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/restaurants/$(restaurantId)).data.owners;
      }
    }
    
    // User profiles
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

### **3. Environment Security**

#### **Environment Variable Management:**
- **Production:** Stored securely in Vercel dashboard
- **Staging:** Separate environment variables for staging project
- **Development:** Local `.env` files (excluded from git)

#### **API Key Restrictions:**
- Firebase API keys restricted to specific domains
- Vercel environment variables encrypted at rest
- No sensitive data in client-side code

## **üá™üá¨ Egyptian Compliance Requirements**

  // Export customer data
  exportCustomerData: async (customerId) => {
    // Implementation for data export
  },
  
  // Delete customer data
  deleteCustomerData: async (customerId) => {
    // Implementation for data deletion
