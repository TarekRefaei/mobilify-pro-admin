   - Push notifications: Simple broadcast to all customers
   - Reservations: Manual request/confirm system

3. **Technical Decisions:**
   - No offline functionality in v1.0
   - Firebase Storage for image uploads
   - Real-time updates using Firestore onSnapshot
   - Multi-tenant architecture with restaurantId isolation

### **Implementation Approach:**

## **Implementation Priority Recommendations**

### **üöÄ Start Immediately (No Dependencies)**
- **Phase 1:** Project setup, folder structure, TypeScript interfaces
- **UI Components:** Build reusable components with Tailwind CSS
- **Mock Data:** Create realistic test data for development

### **‚è≥ Can Wait for Firebase (But Start Planning)**
- **Authentication flows:** Design can be implemented, Firebase integration later
- **Real-time features:** UI can be built, Firestore integration added later
- **Data services:** Interfaces can be defined, implementation added later

### **üìã Requires Business Decisions**
- **Order workflow details:** Specific status transitions and business rules
- **Loyalty program logic:** Points calculation and redemption rules
- **Multi-tenant strategy:** How to handle multiple restaurants per owner

## **Recommended Next Steps**

### **Immediate Actions (This Week)**

1. **Begin Phase 1 Implementation**
   ```bash
   # Start with project initialization
   npm create vite@latest mobilify-admin -- --template react-ts
   cd mobilify-admin
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - Configure VS Code with recommended extensions
   - Set up ESLint and Prettier
   - Create project folder structure

3. **Create Mock Data**
   - Define realistic test orders, menu items, and restaurant data
   - Create mock services that return promises with test data
   - This allows full UI development without Firebase

### **Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)**

1. **Complete Phase 1 & 2**
   - Build main layout and navigation
   - Implement authentication UI (without Firebase initially)
   - Create reusable UI components

2. **Start Phase 3**
   - Build order management UI with mock data
   - Implement Kanban-style layout
   - Add audio notifications

3. **Firebase Setup**
   - Create Firebase project
   - Configure authentication and Firestore
   - Replace mock services with real Firebase integration

### **Medium Term (Weeks 3-6)**

1. **Complete Core Features**
   - Finish order management with real-time updates
   - Implement menu management system
   - Add dashboard and additional features

2. **Quality Assurance**
   - Write comprehensive tests
   - Perform performance optimization
   - Conduct security review

### **Long Term (Weeks 7-8)**

1. **Deployment & Launch**
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Deploy to production
   - Configure monitoring and backups

---

## **Risk Mitigation Strategies**

### **Technical Risks**

1. **Firebase Learning Curve**
   - **Mitigation:** Start with Firebase emulators for development
   - **Backup Plan:** Well-documented Firebase integration examples in PRP

2. **Real-time Performance**
   - **Mitigation:** Implement proper Firestore indexing strategy
   - **Backup Plan:** Fallback to polling if real-time updates fail

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - **Mitigation:** Mobile-first design approach with Tailwind CSS
   - **Backup Plan:** Progressive enhancement for desktop features

### **Business Risks**

1. **Scope Creep**
   - **Mitigation:** Strict adherence to v1.0 scope defined in PRD
   - **Backup Plan:** Feature backlog for future versions clearly defined

2. **User Adoption**
   - **Mitigation:** User-centric design based on detailed personas
   - **Backup Plan:** UAT with real restaurant owners before launch
