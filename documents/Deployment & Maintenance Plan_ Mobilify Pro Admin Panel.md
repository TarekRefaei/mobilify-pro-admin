# **Deployment & Maintenance Plan: Mobilify Pro Admin Panel**

* **Document Version:** 1.0  
* **Date:** July 25, 2025  
* **Core Purpose:** To define the automated processes for releasing, monitoring, and maintaining the application, ensuring high availability and reliability.

### **1\. Deployment Strategy & Providers (Free-Tier Focus)**

Our strategy is to leverage a modern, automated workflow using best-in-class services that offer generous free tiers, perfect for a startup.

* **Source Control:** **GitHub**  
  * **Reason:** Industry standard for version control. The free plan includes private repositories and access to GitHub Actions for automation.  
* **Hosting Provider:** **Vercel**  
  * **Reason:** Offers a seamless, zero-configuration deployment experience for frontend applications. Its "Hobby" plan is free and includes a global CDN, automatic HTTPS, and tight integration with GitHub.  
* **Backend & Database:** **Firebase**  
  * **Reason:** As established, Firebase will serve as our backend. The free "Spark Plan" provides sufficient resources for authentication, Firestore database reads/writes, and hosting security rules for our initial launch.

### **2\. CI/CD Pipeline (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)**

We will use an automated CI/CD pipeline to ensure that every change is automatically tested and deployed, reducing manual errors and increasing release velocity.

* **Automation Tool:** **GitHub Actions**  
  1. **Workflow:** A workflow file (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) will be created in our repository.  
  2. **Trigger:** The workflow will automatically run on every `git push` to the `main` branch.  
* **Pipeline Steps:**  
  1. **Checkout Code:** The runner checks out the latest version of the `main` branch.  
  2. **Install Dependencies:** It runs `npm install` to get all required packages.  
  3. **Run Quality Checks:** It executes `npm run lint` and `npm run test`. **If either of these steps fails, the pipeline stops, and the deployment is aborted.** This is our primary quality gate.  
  4. **Build Application:** If tests pass, it runs `npm run build` to create a production-optimized version of the React app.  
  5. **Deploy to Vercel:** The Vercel for GitHub integration automatically detects the successful build and deploys it to production, making it live for users.

### **4\. Monitoring, Rollbacks, and Maintenance**

#### **4.1. Monitoring**

* **Uptime Monitoring:** We will use **UptimeRobot**. The free plan will ping our live Vercel URL every 5 minutes and send an instant alert via email if the site is down.  
* **Application Error Monitoring:** We will integrate the **Sentry** SDK into our React application. The free "Developer" plan will capture and report any runtime errors that occur in the users' browsers, allowing us to fix bugs before users even report them.

#### **4.2. Rollback Procedure**

* **Vercel's Atomic Deployments:** Vercel makes rollbacks incredibly simple and safe. Every deployment is immutable.  
* **One-Click Rollback:** If a bug is discovered in production, the rollback procedure is:  
  1. Go to the Vercel project dashboard.  
  2. View the list of all past deployments.  
  3. Find the last known stable deployment.  
  4. Click the "Promote to Production" button. *The rollback is instant (less than 5 seconds) and requires no code changes or new deployments.*

#### **4.3. Maintenance & Backups**

* **Database Backups:** While Firebase is highly reliable, we will set up our own automated weekly backup for disaster recovery.  
  * **Tool:** A scheduled **GitHub Action** will run once a week.  
  * **Process:** The action will use the `gcloud` command-line tool to export the entire Firestore database and save it to a **Google Cloud Storage** bucket. Both services have free tiers sufficient for this task.  
* **Dependency Management:** We will enable **Dependabot** in our GitHub repository. Dependabot automatically scans our project for outdated or insecure dependencies and creates pull requests to update them, keeping our application secure over time.
